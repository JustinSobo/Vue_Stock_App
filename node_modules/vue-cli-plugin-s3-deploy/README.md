s3-deploy for vue-cli
===

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vue-cli-plugin-s3-deploy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/vue-cli-plugin-s3-deploy)

This [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) plugin aims to make it easier to deploy a built Vue.js app to an S3 bucket.

Supports:

* Custom AWS regions
* Concurrent uploads for improved deploy times
* Correct `Cache-Control` metadata for use with PWAs and Service Workers

Prerequisites
---

You must have a set of [valid AWS credentials set up on your system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html).


Installation
---
```
yarn add vue-cli-plugin-s3-deploy
```

Usage
---

After installation, invoke the plugin with `vue invoke s3-deploy`.

Answer the configuration prompts. This will inject a `deploy` script command into your
`package.json` file.

Deploy your app with `yarn deploy`

Options
---
```
--bucket    The S3 bucket name, eg: my-site-bucket (required)
--region AWS region for the specified bucket (default: us-east-1)
--assetPath The path to the built assets (default: dist)
--pwa       Sets max-age=0 for the PWA-related files specified
```

The `pwa` option is meant to help make deploying progressive web apps a little
easier. Due to the way service workers interact with caching, this option alone will tell
the browser to not cache the `service-worker.js` file by default. This ensures that changes made to the service worker are reflected as quickly as possible.

You can specify which files aren't cached by passing a value to the option:

`--pwa=index.html,dont-cache.css,not-this.js`

Per-Environment Options
---

Deployment options can be overridden but .env files to support development, stating, and production deployment environments.

The .env file options are:

```
VUE_APP_S3D_BUCKET=staging-bucket
VUE_APP_S3D_ASSET_PATH=dist/staging
VUE_APP_S3D_REGION=staging-cloud-provider-east-1
VUE_APP_S3D_PWA=service-worker-stage.js
VUE_APP_S3D_CONCURRENCY=3
```

**These options OVERRIDE the cli options set in package.json** and should be used to customize a default set of options. A common use case is only overriding `VUE_APP_S3D_BUCKET` for production deployment.


Changelog
---

**v1.3**: Added support for .env files and per-environment options

**v1.2**: Added parallel uploading

**v1.1**: Initial Release
